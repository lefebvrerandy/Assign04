*  PROGRAMMER    : Randy Lefebvre & Bence Karner
*  DESCRIPTION   : This file contains the starting point of the Server applications. The program 
*                  creates a file, and logs the start of the application before executing its networking
*                  functionality. The purpose of the server is to open unidirectional pipes for all incoming,
*                  and outgoing connections from the clients. The applications receives messages from the clients
*                  and redirects them to everyone connected to the pipes.
